# 🔍 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project predicts whether a customer will **churn (leave)** or **stay** based on service usage, demographic, and account-related features. It uses both **classical machine learning models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and a **neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras**.
